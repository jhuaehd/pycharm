MODULE 1. SOFTWARES
1. Software - collection of computer programs that helps us to perform a task.
2. Types of software
	a. System Software
	    - device drivers, Operating systems, servers, utilities
	b. Programming software
        - compilers, debuggers, interpreters
	c. Application software
		- Web app, Mobile app, Desktop app

3. SOFTWARE TESTING – a part of software development process.
                 - An activity to detect and identify the defects in the software. The objective of testing is to release quality product to the client.
4. SOFTWARE QUALITY – bug free,  delivered on time, within the budget, meet requirements and expectations, maintainable

5. PROJECT VS PRODUCT
    If software application is developed for specific customer based on the requirement then it is called PROJECT.
    If software application developed for multiple customers based on market requirements then it called PRODUCT.

6. WHY DO WE NEED TESTING ? –  to ensure software don’t have any bugs, to ensure it will satisfy the requirements and expectation of the client and deliver the software in exact time.

7. ERROR, BUG AND ERROR
        - an incorrect human action is ERROR, human mistake
        - unwanted feature is BUG, mismatch feature, defect
        - something that is not working in the application after the deployment to client

8. WHY SOFTWARE HAS BUGS
        - miscommunication or no communication
        - software complexity
        - Programming errors
        - Changing in requirements
        - lack of skilled testers
